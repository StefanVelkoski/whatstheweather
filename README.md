# whatstheweather
Shows you current the weather for any city.

This project was created with Angular and Node.js.

I created a Node.js API that uses  the `mapbox.com` API to locate the coordinates of the city the user has entered, and the `weatherstack.com` API to 
fetch the weather data for the exact location.

For the frontend and the requests for the node.js API I used Angular.

The next iteration of this app is planned to integrate Google speech to text and text to speech API.
