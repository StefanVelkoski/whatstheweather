# whatstheweather
Shows you current weather for any city.

This project was create with Angular and node.js.

I created a node.js API that uses  the `mapbox.com` api to locate the coordinates of the city the user has entered, and the `weatherstack.com` api to 
fetch the weather data for the exact location.

For the frontend and the requests for the node.js API requests I used Angular.
